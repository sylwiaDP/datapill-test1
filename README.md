## **What is DATA Pill?**

DATA Pill is a community where we **share interesting content**: articles, podcasts, videos, upcomming events and all recommendations of **what is useful to us, #devpeople**. 

There are already more than 1,200 of us and we just launched. 

**Every week on Friday we send out a collection of the best Cloud, AI, ML and Big Data content**  recommended by our community and selected by researchers in the **[datapill.tech](https://datapill.tech/)** newsletter.

Remember the Matrix scene where Morpheus gives Neo a choice? 
You take one pill - nothing changes, you stay in the old, safe world (although it is an illusion).
You take the other pill - you enter the new world, the Matrix, and gain consciousness.

So take the DATA Pill to enter DATA Matrix and gain awareness of new trends and technologies.

[Here](https://datapill.tech/) You can also find all previous editions of the newsletter.
